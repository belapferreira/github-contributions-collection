### :pushpin: Context

At the end of 2020, during one of the first hiring processes I participated in, the challenge was developing a kind of clone of the GitHub contributions heatmap. I made it, using a library, and the idea was to create it from scratch. And guess what: I didn't move forward in the process üòÖ.

Earlier this year (2024), I was assigned to implement the components of a profile page, one of which was a heatmap. This time, as I improved my skills, I could build it from scratch.

And I just wanted to reproduce part of that here as a way to say to my past self thank you for keeping going and to my current, and fortunately to my future self, never stop learning! üçÄüíô


### :gear: Settings

The settings to execute the application on your computer are listed below.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com);
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/);
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### :arrow_down_small: Cloning the repository

1. Through the terminal, go to the directory where you want to have the repository cloned and run the following command:

```bash
# cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/belapferreira/github-contributions-collection
```

### :beginner: Starting the application

1. Open the code of the repo cloned, create a `.env.local` file and add the variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_GRAPHQL_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_TOKEN` (the GitHub GraphQL API URL is https://api.github.com/graphql and the `token` you must generate one).

2. Through the terminal, go to the directory where the repository was cloned and run the following command:

```bash
# installing dependencies
yarn install

# starting application
yarn dev
```
